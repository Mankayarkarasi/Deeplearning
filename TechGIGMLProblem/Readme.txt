Models to analyze the followings:

Key differentiating sequences/sub-sequences/clicks between three groups
Factors lead to drop out of users & where they drop out
Presentation of the approach used to develop the framework
Which should describes hypothesis formulation and data usages, Feature creation and selection, Intervention strategy for group 2 and 3 and Model and technique used.


Evaluation Criteria:


Hypothesis formulation and data usages
Feature creation and selection
Intervention strategy for group 2 and 3
Model and technique used
Accuracy of prediction
